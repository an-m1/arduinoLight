## Overview

The website is fully optimized for both desktop and mobile users, providing a seamless experience with its minimalist yet visually appealing design.

## Features

- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Background colors change depending on the light toggle state (on/off).
- **Modern Typography**: Clean and readable fonts for a polished look.
- **Gradient Headline**: Eye-catching gradient text to highlight the website’s purpose.
- **Navbar and Footer**:
  - **Navbar**: Includes navigation links that adapt for smaller screens using Bootstrap’s collapsible functionality.
  - **Footer**: Minimalistic design with dynamic year display and hover effects on links.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend Libraries and Frameworks
- **Bootstrap 5**: For layout and responsive design.
- **CSS3**: For custom styles, including animations, gradients, and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive features, such as the toggle functionality and dynamic elements.

### Fonts and Icons
- **Google Fonts (Poppins)**: For modern typography.
- **FontAwesome**: For icons like the lightbulb used in the button design.

## How It Was Made
1. **Setup**:
   - Basic HTML structure was created using semantic tags.
   - Bootstrap 5 was integrated via a CDN for layout and responsive utilities.

2. **Styling**:
   - Custom CSS was written to enhance the design beyond Bootstrap defaults.
   - Animations and hover effects were added to the button using `@keyframes` and transitions.

3. **Functionality**:
   - JavaScript was used to implement the light toggle logic and update the background dynamically.
   - The current year is displayed in the footer using JavaScript.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Media queries and Bootstrap’s grid system were used to ensure compatibility with different devices.

## How to Use the Website
1. Open the index.html in any modern web browser.
2. Click the glowing button in the center to toggle the light on or off.
3. Observe the background and button text updating dynamically.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more interactive elements, such as sound effects or additional animations.
- Save the toggle state using local storage to persist the light state across sessions.
- Include advanced accessibility features to make the website more inclusive.
- **Make the website work on Github Pages, instead of only locally. The website only runs properly locally as of Dec. 19, 2024.**
